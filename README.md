# hello-world
I think you get it

This is just a place to get to know GitHub, and maybe visa-versa.

I'm basically a .NET guy who has made a lot of progress with C# over the last 10 years or so. 
I've had years of experience with SQL databases, I'm pretty proficient with Linq, but now
I'm really interested in APIs and trying to wrap my head around REST and using Node.js
and new funky document databases like CouchDB.

Right now it is giving me a headache and keeping me up at night, but I think it might get to be fun.
